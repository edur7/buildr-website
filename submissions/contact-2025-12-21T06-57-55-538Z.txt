message: Hi there, 
 
Getting some set of links pointing to buildrcanada.com could have zero worth or harmful results for your site. 
 
It really makes no difference the total external links you have, what is crucial is the number of search terms those domains are optimized for. 
 
That is the most important factor. 
Not the meaningless Moz DA or Domain Rating. 
That anyone can do these days. 
BUT the number of high-traffic search terms the domains that point to your site rank for. 
That’s the bottom line. 
 
Get these quality links redirect to your site and you will ROCK!
