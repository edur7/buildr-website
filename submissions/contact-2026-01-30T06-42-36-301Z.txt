message: Through death, the family is not destroyed, it is transformed; a part of it passes into the unseen. We believe that death is an absence, when in fact it is a discreet presence. 
I am suffering from a serious illness that will lead to my certain death. 
I have €512,000 in my bank account, which I would like to donate. 
Please contact me if you are interested.
