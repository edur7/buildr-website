subject: buildrcanada.com: Most sites get this wrong when monetizing

Hi, it’s Jayrn.

If your site already uses — or is preparing to use — affiliate links, this will be relevant.

One issue I see constantly is that monetization is treated as something you “add later,” instead of something that’s designed into the site from the beginning.

That usually leads to:
random placement of links
unclear visitor intent
unpredictable income

It works, but never consistently.

I put together a short explanation of why this happens and what changes once monetization is structured properly:

You’ll know quickly whether this applies to your situation.

PS: And one quick note so you’re not wondering why you’re hearing from me:
I only reach out to website owners because they’re the ones actively building something online. I’m not blasting random emails. 
I’m simply sharing a resource that has been helping a lot of people create predictable online income. If it resonates, great. If not, no worries.
