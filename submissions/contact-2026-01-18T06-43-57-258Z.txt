message: Hello, 
 
Getting some set of links redirecting to buildrcanada.com may result in zero worth or harmful results for your business. 
 
It really doesn’t matter the number of backlinks you have, what matters is the number of search terms those websites are optimized for. 
 
That is the key thing. 
Not the meaningless Moz DA or SEO score. 
That anyone can do these days. 
BUT the volume of Google-ranked terms the domains that link to you contain. 
That’s it. 
 
Make sure these backlinks link to your domain and your site will see real growth!
