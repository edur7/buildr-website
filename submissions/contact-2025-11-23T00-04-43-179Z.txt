message: Hello, 
 
Receiving some collection of links pointing to buildrcanada.com may result in no value or worse for your business. 
 
It really doesn’t matter how many external links you have, what is key is the amount of keywords those domains are optimized for. 
 
That is the key factor. 
Not the fake third-party metrics or ahrefs DR score. 
Anyone can manipulate those. 
BUT the volume of high-traffic search terms the domains that link to you have. 
That’s it. 
 
Have such links link to your domain and your rankings will skyrocket!
